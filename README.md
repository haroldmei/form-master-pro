### Field Mapping Guide

#### Direct Value Mapping

Use for static text values:

- Mapping Type: `direct`
- Mapping Value: `John`

#### Table Cell Mapping

Extract data from a specific table cell:
- Field ID: `email`
- Mapping Type: `table`
- Mapping Value: `0,2,1` (table 0, row 2, column 1)

#### Regex Pattern Mapping

Use regular expressions to extract specific data:
- Field ID: `phoneNumber`
- Mapping Type: `regex`
- Mapping Value: `Phone:\s*(\d+)` (extracts digits after "Phone:")

### Troubleshooting

- **Connection Issues**: Ensure the companion app is running and shows "Connected"
- **Form Detection Problems**: Try refreshing the page before analyzing
