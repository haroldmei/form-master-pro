### Pull Request Review

- Once approved, a maintainer will merge your PR

## Coding Standards

### JavaScript Style

- Use modern ES6+ syntax
- Use `const` for constants, `let` for variables
- Use arrow functions where appropriate
- Keep functions small and focused (< 50 lines)
- Use descriptive variable and function names
- Avoid deeply nested code (max 3 levels)

### Example

```javascript
// Good
const getUserProfile = async () => {
  try {
    const profile = await fetchProfile();
    return processProfile(profile);
  } catch (error) {
    console.error('Error fetching profile:', error);
    throw error;
  }
};

// Avoid
function xyz() {
  chrome.storage.local.get(['data'], function(result) {
    if (result.data) {
      if (result.data.profile) {
        if (result.data.profile.name) {
          // Too deeply nested
        }
      }
    }
  });
}
```

### Comments

- Add comments for complex logic
- Use JSDoc for functions with parameters
- Explain "why" not "what" when the code is clear
- Keep comments up-to-date with code changes

```javascript
/**
 * Extract form fields from the current webpage
 * 
 * @param {Object} options - Extraction options
 * @param {boolean} options.includeHidden - Include hidden fields
 * @returns {Array<Object>} Array of field objects
 */
function extractFormFields(options = {}) {
  // Implementation
}
```

### File Organization

- Keep related functionality together
- Use modules for separation of concerns
- Avoid circular dependencies
- Export only what's needed

## Commit Message Guidelines
